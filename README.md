Examples of reinforcement machine learning models

## In the repository we will look at implementing the following reinforcement learning models:
+ Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
+ Thompson Sampling

Reinforcement learning is used when we want to solve problems wher data has been recorded from time $t_{0}$ through $t$ and we want to know what to do at time $t+1$. These models learn through trial-and-error, where desired outcomes can provide AI constructs with a reward, while unwanted outcomes garner punitive recompense (been wanting to use that word for a long while now).
